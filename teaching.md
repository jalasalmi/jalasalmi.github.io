### Teaching

I teach mathematics, microeconomics and game theory at the University of Konstanz. 

 - Quantitative Methods in Economics (tutorials and lectures) WS/2018-2022 [Course materials here](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/s/W3i6W8CTwHcjyaa)
 - Advanced Microeconomics (tutorials) WS/2018-2022
 - Microeconomics II (Game Theory) (tutorials) SS/2019, 2021

I'm developing a concise and intuitive text for new graduate students in need of revising their math, see [here.](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/s/nSm3TmENpPX3q6C)
